// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// from exercise 11
const names1: string[] = ["Asiya", "Fatima", "Faria", "Muntaha", "Mehreen"];

// Print each person's name with text
for (const i of names1) {
    console.log(i,", is my best friend");
}
